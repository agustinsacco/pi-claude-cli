/**
 * pi's thinking level, translated into what Claude Code sends to the model.
 *
 * The contract is parity with pi's own Anthropic provider (pi-ai
 * `api/anthropic-messages.js`, `streamSimple`): the same level must reach the
 * model as the same request fields whichever path carries it. Claude Code
 * exposes two ways to set them, both verified on the wire through a logging
 * proxy on claude 2.1.283 and present since 2.1.263 (the pi-context floor):
 *
 * - spawn flags: `--thinking disabled`, `--max-thinking-tokens N`,
 *   `--effort X`, `--thinking-display D` (all hidden from `--help`);
 * - control requests on a live process: `set_max_thinking_tokens` and
 *   `apply_flag_settings {effortLevel}`. Each applies from the next user turn.
 *
 * One flag set serves every model. Budget-thinking models (Haiku 4.5, Opus
 * 4.5, Sonnet 4.5) read `--max-thinking-tokens` and ignore the effort;
 * adaptive models read the effort and treat any positive budget as "on". So
 * nothing here needs to know which kind a model is.
 *
 * Before 0.10.0 only `--effort` was ever passed. Budget models ignored it and
 * thought with the CLI's 31,999-token default at every level, pi's `off`
 * reached the CLI as no flag at all (so Sonnet 5 ran adaptive at effort
 * `high`), and adaptive models streamed no thinking text because the CLI's
 * default display is `omitted`.
